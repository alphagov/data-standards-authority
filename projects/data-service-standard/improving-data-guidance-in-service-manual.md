# Improving data guidance in the Service Manual

In March and April of 2021, the Data Standards Authority (DSA) undertook five workshops with a total of around 100 data experts from across government, as part of work to improve standards and assurance of government services’ data-related work.

The data experts provided extensive points and ideas on how to improve data in government. Themes included data quality, architecture, interoperability and information sources used amongst many others.

The DSA is now collaborating with the Community-led [Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard) and [Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual) team, with a focus on the Service Manual’s end users, researching the needs of data-related standards and guidance. These users include people with expert data capabilities, but also data newcomers.

We aim to discover what data-related guidance is needed to improve the Service Manual, help service teams meet the requirements of the Service Standard, and support the priorities identified by data experts.

The kinds of things we’re looking to understand about our end users include:
* who the audience is for data guidance
* current data practices
* gaps in existing data guidance
* barriers to implementing current data guidance

We’ll look at more specific questions, like:
* What drives users to data-related guidance? What are they trying to find out?
* What are users’ responsibilities relating to data architecture, life cycle, management and * quality control?
* What works well and less well about how teams collect, store, process, share, and publish data?
* Are teams aware of the technical, legal, and ethical standards that they need to meet?

The findings will help us ensure guidance is realistic and reflects the needs of people working with data and makes sense to people with all levels of data capability.

A DSA team member will attend all research sessions as an observer, because user research is a team sport.

We will keep communities and stakeholders up to date by working in the open and sharing developing timelines, information, content and artefacts.
