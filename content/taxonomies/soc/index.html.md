The evaluation document is available [in PDF format](/taxonomies/soc/Taxonomy_Evaluation_Document_SOC_FINAL.pdf) and [in ODT format](/taxonomies/soc/Taxonomy_Evaluation_Document_SOC_FINAL.odt).

SOC is hierarchical in structure and is used to classify occupations (jobs) by skill level and specialisation.  Skill levels are approximated by the length of time necessary for a person to become fully competent in the performance of the tasks associated with a job, including training and qualifications. SOC 2020 is categorised into four skill levels.

SOC is used to classify occupations to most sources of occupational statistics in the UK. SOC 2020 is also used by other organisations for their own purposes.

Methodology on the current SOC 2020 is available from SOC 2020 Volume 1 - structure and descriptions of unit groups. ONS publish tables showing the relationship between the previous and new classification. The current relationship tables for SOC2010 and SOC2020 and the user guide are available from here.

### Metadata:
- The [SOC index](https://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=/methodology/classificationsandstandards/standardoccupationalclassificationsoc/soc2020/soc2020volume2codingrulesandconventions/soc2020volume2thecodingindexexcel011021.xlsx) includes a ‘FILE SPEC’ tab that includes information on the excel workbook.

### Crosswalks and limitations:
The major group structure is a set of broad occupational categories which are designed to bring together groups which are similar in terms of qualifications, training, skills and experience. These categories aim to align SOC as far as possible with the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO).
SOC Volume 2 – the coding index maps directly to ISCO08 by job title

Some existing users of SOC have expressed that the existing structure, with the lowest level being 4 digits, is not sufficiently granular to meet their needs. More information on the SOC-extension project is available here.
