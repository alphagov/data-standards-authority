# Common Format and MIME Type for Comma-Separated Values (CSV) Files

You can use this standard for publishing data, where your data has a variety of uses and is for many users. This standard does not cover non-tabular models of data. For example:
- multiple tables with relations, such as SQL
- hierarchical/flexible records, such as XML or JSON
- geographic, such as GeoJSON
- graph/triples, such as RDF
This standard does not cover extra information about the tabular data, such as the column types, or table contents validation. You should keep this type of information separate from a CSV file to avoid it conflicting with the data structure as described in RFC 4180..
