short_description: A standardised way of recording and sharing information about how the public sector uses algorithmic tools.
---

The Algorithmic Transparency Recording Standard helps public sector organisations provide clear information about the algorithmic tools they use, and why theyâ€™re using them.
Algorithmic transparency means being open about how algorithmic tools support decisions. This includes providing information on algorithmic tools and algorithm-assisted decisions in a complete, open, understandable, easily-accessible, and free format.
