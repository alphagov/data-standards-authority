short_description: DOI introduces persistent identifiers for research and information assets
---

The DOI system enables persistent identifiers with permanent web addresses
to be assigned to key information assets published by government, using an
external registration agency. DOIs help to make key resources, such as data, insights, bulletins and policy documents findable, citable and better connected.
