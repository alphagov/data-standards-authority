# Data Standards Authority

# Who we are
We're the Data Standards Authority team, working to improve how the public sector manages data. We're establishing standards, writing guidance and building things to make it easier and more effective to share and use data across government. 

You can find our web page on GOV.UK at https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/data-standards-authority, on UK Goverment Digital Slack in #data-standards-authority, or email us at data-standards-authority@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk
