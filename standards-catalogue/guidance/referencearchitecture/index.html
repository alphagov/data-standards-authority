<p>This guidance is a reference architecture. It will help you build your IT infrastructure so it supports operational and analytical processes that focus on using data and APIs. It suggests best practices and a maturity model.</p>

<p>Developing your government organisation’s technical estate can help you to:</p>

<ul>
<li>  reduce your IT spend by increasing functionality, reusability and availability of your technology</li>
<li>  reduce government technology lock-in by increasing your organisation’s interoperability with other government technology</li>
<li>  reduce the time and money you spend on Freedom of Information requests by proactively publishing data</li>
<li>  promote technical innovation across government services by using new technologies</li>
<li>  improve the way you communicate across government, by making it easier to share data between organisations</li>
<li>  standardise your technology, by helping you understand how different technical and data standards fit together</li>
<li>  encourage you to adopt existing open standards, and engage with the standards’ development</li>
<li>  move away from document-based processes and systems to those based on standardised data, as <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-national-data-strategy/national-data-strategy#open-data">suggested by the National Data Strategy</a></li>
<li>  encourage cultural change in your organisation by building services that are interoperable with others both inside and outside government</li>
<li>  respond to feedback from users and resolve identified problems</li>
</ul>

<p>By following this reference architecture, your services will meet the main requirements of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard">Service Standard</a> and the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/digital-and-technology-spend-controls-version-5">spend controls process</a>. This does not replace the spend controls process, or the need to go through a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-assessments">service assessment</a>.</p>
<h2 id="plan-your-architecture-using-a-maturity-model">Plan your architecture using a maturity model</h2>
<p>You will need to assess the maturity of your reference architecture.</p>

<p>At a minimum, the architecture you build should:</p>

<ul>
<li>  offer a service which can scale with demand using <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-cloud-first-policy">cloud technology</a></li>
<li>  provide access <a href="https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/manual/add-authentication-to-an-application.html">through a common authentication standard</a>, such as <a href="https://oauth.net/2/">OAuth</a></li>
<li>  produce data <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-standards-principles">using the Open Standards Principles</a></li>
<li>  give users access to data using a documented API</li>
<li>  use <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/recommended-open-standards-for-government/describing-restful-apis-with-openapi-3">OpenAPI 3</a> to document REST APIs</li>
<li>  let external users access the system where appropriate</li>
</ul>

<p>This model is one way of assessing and developing the maturity of your architecture:</p>

<h2 id="build-an-architecture-that-promotes-data-exchange-across-government">Build an architecture that promotes data exchange across government</h2>
<p>Government organisations use different systems for different needs, for example HR, communications or statistical systems. Sometimes these can be unique to an organisation.</p>

<p>You should aim to build an architecture that makes it easier to exchange data with other government organisations. You can do this by making sure your:</p>

<ul>
<li>  system can exchange data with other systems by being as interoperable as possible</li>
<li>  system produces data in an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-standards-principles/open-standards-principles">open standard format</a></li>
<li>  system has an API</li>
<li>  API is documented according to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/recommended-open-standards-for-government/describing-restful-apis-with-openapi-3">the OpenAPI specification</a></li>
<li>  API uses a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/gds-api-technical-and-data-standards#to-provide-application-level-authorisation">common authentication protocol</a></li>
<li>  systems documentation is up to date and clearly shows how they connect to other systems</li>
</ul>

<p>You should also make sure:</p>

<ul>
<li>  users outside of government are able to access your data, where appropriate, using an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/gds-api-technical-and-data-standards#when-to-authenticate-your-api">appropriately authenticated API</a></li>
<li>  external organisations can reuse software you create</li>
<li>  data you use is gathered from core data sets and does not <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/manage-your-data-for-access-and-reuse">replicate core data</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="reuse-applications-and-common-data">Reuse applications and common data</h3>
<p>When building your architecture, you should <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/share-and-reuse-technology">look for existing software and services</a> which fit your needs, and reuse them. This includes those developed by other organisations.</p>

<p>Your organisation should decide whether to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/define-your-purchasing-strategy">buy or build</a>, but you must follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/digital-and-technology-spend-controls-version-5">GDS spend controls process</a>. You should make as much of your data as interoperable as possible by <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/integrate-and-adapt-technology">following point 9 of the Technology Code of Practice</a>.</p>

<p>Where possible, you should make use of shared platforms such as <a href="https://www.cloud.service.gov.uk/">GOV.UK PaaS</a>, which can host your service in the government cloud. You can also use existing government platforms that carry out specific services. For example, instead of building a new payment system, you should use <a href="https://www.payments.service.gov.uk/">GOV.UK Pay</a>.</p>

<p>If a cross-government solution does not yet exist, you should consult with other teams to see if they have solved a similar issue and work together on developing a common solution.</p>

<p>You should design and develop technology with the expectation that it could become part of Government as a Platform in the future. This means following <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/point-14-operate-a-reliable-service">GDS Service Manual guidelines</a> on operating a reliable and scalable platform.</p>

<p>Technology development should <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-source-guidance">happen in the open</a>. Where appropriate, all your code should be open source, and licenced for other people to reuse. You should understand the intellectual property (IP) rights if you’re using technology developed by a third party. \</p>

<p>You should reuse existing datasets whenever possible. You should be careful not to rebuild datasets that already exist.</p>

<p>All data should use approved open data standards and<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/recommended-open-standards-for-government/using-metadata-to-describe-csv-data"> include metadata to allow other people to reuse it</a>.</p>
<h3 id="follow-a-services-and-systems-model-based-on-data">Follow a services and systems model based on data</h3>
<p>You should aim for an approach to services and systems in your organisation based around data, and move towards an approach <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-national-data-strategy/national-data-strategy">based on standardised data</a>.</p>

<p>A &ldquo;service&rdquo; is the method by which users interact with the government, for example <a href="https://www.gov.uk/renew-driving-licence">Renew your driving licence</a>. It is a group of multiple, interoperable systems that ingests, stores, manipulates, and produces data.</p>

<p>A &ldquo;system&rdquo; is one of the components which makes up a service. For example, the database storing the information, the sign in system, or an analytics platform.</p>

<p>Your organisation should follow a model which transforms unstructured data into structured data as soon as possible when the data arrives.</p>

<p>This model should create a record of all events and transactions relating to that data, then store both the data and its record in a database. This allows for more consistent data that is easy to manipulate and retrieve. It also helps to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/manage-your-data-for-access-and-reuse">make sure that data is accessible and reusable</a>.</p>

<p>When your data is requested by other people, it must be provided as structured data through an API. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/api-design-guidance">Read guidance about designing, building and running APIs</a> to best suit your organisation’s needs.</p>

<p>Your data-based model can transform this into unstructured data, for example customer data being turned into a postable paper document.</p>
